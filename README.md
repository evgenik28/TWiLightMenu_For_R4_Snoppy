## Project Overview

This project provides a custom firmware solution for the **R4 Snoppy Plus** cartridge, which is not supported by standard flashing tools.  
The firmware is based on **PICO firmware** combined with **TWiLight Menu++** to deliver full compatibility and modern functionality.

## Key Features

- Fully functional custom firmware for an unsupported cartridge.
- Bootloader reconstruction using PICO firmware method.
- Native support for TWiLight Menu++ with full features.
- Designed for reliability and compatibility.

## Requirements

- R4 Snoppy Plus cartridge
- microSD card with TWiLight Menu++ files
- PICO firmware files from this repository

## Important Notes

This firmware was created **because the original flashing mechanism does not work** on the R4 Snoppy Plus.  
It uses **PICO firmware** as the foundation to provide a stable and reliable way to run TWiLight Menu++ on this otherwise incompatible cartridge.
